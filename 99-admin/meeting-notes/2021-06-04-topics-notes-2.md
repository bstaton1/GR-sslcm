# GR-SSLCM Meeting 6/4/2021

## Topic: How to model fishery mortality

**Attendees**: Ellis, Gibson, Liermann, Self, Staton

### Summary of Discussion

* Stuart gave a pretty detailed overview of Columbia River fisheries. This was useful to me (Staton), since I have had little exposure to this topic, but not a ton that was very relevant to our purposes for the LCM.
* We did learn that there are two main areas of harvest to consider: downstream of Bonneville are the primary mark-selective fisheries and upstream of Bonnefille the tribal fisheries are non-mark-selective. In mark-selective fisheries, the harvest rate varies between 5-10% generally for hatchery origin fish and mortality for natural origin fish is entirely release mortality so it should be quite low. Tribal fisheries harvest rates are also on the order of 5-10% and should apply relatively equally to both hatchery and natural origin fish.
* These rates are lower than I expected, and are small relative to many of the sea lion estimates we will likely be using.
* We learned that age-3 fish are harvested at much lower rates than age-4 or age-5 fish.
* We did not touch much on other sources of main-stem mortality (e.g., passage failures), but I got the impression that they have some data that could be used to estimate this relatively easily.
* We plan to meet sometime the week of June 7 to drill into their spreadsheets and calculate some reasonable rates that we can use. Similar to the sea lion model, we will likely derive some time blocks where mortality is constant within them rather than trying to pass the model truly annual values. Anyone is welcom to join, but I envision this will be a fairly tedious discussion and and I'm happy to go alone.

### Follow-up Steps

* Have a follow-up meeting with Stuart and Kate to drill into their spreadsheets and obtain specific numbers we can use.
